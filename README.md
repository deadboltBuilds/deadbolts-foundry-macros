# deadbolts-foundry-macros
 Collection of the macros I have made for my dnd campaign.
 
 **hitdice_macro:** Allows player to roll multiple hit dice at once. Takes class in to account and multiplies the constitution modifier appropriately. Doesn't support multiclassing currently.
 
 **adventuringrest_macro:** Supports my homebrew rules for the adventuring phase. During an adventuring phase you don't regain full hitpoints. You instead roll a number of hit dice equal to 1/2 your level rounded down plus your constitution modifier. This doesn't decrement your total hit dice. This macro applies a long rest to all players, restores their old hp before the long rest, and then heals them automatically using the homebrew rule.
